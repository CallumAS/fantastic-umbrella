**Description:** If you're nervous about your first coding interview, or anxious about applying to your next job, this is the course for you.  I got tired of interviewers asking tricky questions that can only be answered if you've seen the problem before, so I made this course!  This video course will teach you the most common interview questions that you'll see in a coding interview, giving you the tools you need to ace your next whiteboard interview.

P.S. I even used JavaScript to scrape this list from udemy:

```javascript
const elements = document.querySelectorAll('span.truncate-with-tooltip--ellipsis--2-jEx[style="-webkit-line-clamp: 2;"]');

elements.forEach(element => {
    console.log(element.textContent);
});
```

Yoink it if you need it!
